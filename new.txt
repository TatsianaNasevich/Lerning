Happiness
is holding hands and going away together
happiness
is an innocent look, in the middle of a crowd
happiness
is staying close like children, happiness6
happiness

You can feel in the air
our love song that flies
like a thought that knows about happiness
You can feel in the air
a warmer ray of sun that flows27
like a smile that knows about happiness

You can feel in the air
a warmer ray of sun that flows48
like a smile that knows about happiness
